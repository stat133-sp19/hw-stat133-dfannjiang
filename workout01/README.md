The purpose of this assignment are:

1. To start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub.
2. To practice doing data analytics. More especifically, I will be producing so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations.
3. To practice producing a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.
