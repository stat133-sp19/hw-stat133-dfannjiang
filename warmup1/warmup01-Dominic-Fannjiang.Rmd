### Ingredients
#### Dough
* 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 3/4 cup (175 ml) whole or low-fat milk
* 3 1/2 teaspoons (11 grams) instant yeast
* 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar
* 3 large eggs
* 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 4 1/2 cups (585 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt

#### Filling
* 2/3 cup (135 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 2 cups (about 250 grams or 9 ounces) mixed nuts
* Finely grated zest of half a lemon or orange
* A few pinches of sea salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon rose water or orange flower water (optional, to taste)
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves and/or cardamom (optional)
* 1/3 cup (75 grams) unsalted butter, melted

#### Honey Syrup
* 3/4 cup (250 grams) honey, any kind you like
* 3/4 cup (175 ml) water
* Pinch of sea salt

### Special Kitchen Equipment
* One tube pan
* Food Processor

### Directions
1. Make the dough: Mix butter, milk, yeast, sugar, eggs, vanila, flour, and salt. Mix until smooth and set aside for 1 to 2 hours to let it rise.
2. Make the filling: Combine cinnamon and sugar and set aside. Combine nuts, salt, vanilla, and zest in food processor until finely chopped and set aside.
3. Prepare pan: Coat the tube pan with butter or non-stick spray.
4. Assemble babka: Roll out dough. Brush dough with melted butter. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. Spring the ground nuts. Roll up the dough into a long, tight tube. Seal the ends. Cut tube in half and lay the two pieces parallel and next to each other. Put one tube over the other to make a twist between the 2 pieces and after that's done, pinch the ends together. Put the twisted dough into the tube pan. 
5. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes. 
6. Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
7. Bake babka for 30-40 minutes, or until tops are a deep golden brown.
8. Make syrup: Combine honey, water, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce to simmer and cook until reduced by 1/3. Pour and brush the syrup all over the babka.
9. Let babka cool until lukewarm. 

### Notes
* If you only have active dry yeast (instead of instant yeast), then replace half the milk with water. Warm water to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and stir yeast into it and set aside for 5-10 minutes, after which it will be slightly foamy. Then proceed as written.
* The recipe works great with other nut and flavor compositions (i.e. using other spices besides cinnamon and different kinds of nuts).
* The recipe is great for all seasons!

# Euclidean Distance
## Definition 
***
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connection them ($\overline{\mathbf{pq}}$).
In Caretesian coordinates, if **p** = $(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)$ and **q** = $(q_1, q_2, ..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean $n$-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2}\\
=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}$$
The position of a point in a Euclidean $n$-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$||\mathbf{p}||=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}},$$
where the last expression involves the dot product.
