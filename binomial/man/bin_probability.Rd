\title{Probability of successes in a number of trials}
\usage{
bin_probability(success, trials, prob)
}
\arguments{
\item{success}{(numeric) the number of successes (can be a vector)}

\item{trials}{(numeric) the number of trials}

\item{prob}{(numeric) the probability of success on each trial}
}
\value{
The probability that number(s) of successes happen in a certain number of trials.
}
\description{
Computes the probability that number(s) of successes happen in a certain number of trials.
}
\examples{
# one success - probability of 3 successes in 5 trials
# with 50\% chance of success on each trial
bin_probability(3, 5, 0.5)

# multiple successes - probability of 3, 4 successes in 5 trials
# with 50\% chance of success on each trial
bin_probability(3:4, 5, 0.5)
